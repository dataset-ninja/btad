**BTAD: beanTech Anomaly Detection Dataset** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the manufacturing industry, and in the anomaly detection research. 

The dataset consists of 2540 images with 691 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *product_2*, *product_1*, and *product_3*.

Images in the BTAD dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 2261 (89% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *test* (741 images) and *train* (1799 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 image sets: ***ko*** (290 images) and ***ok*** (2250 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the beanTech, Italy and University of Udine, Italy.
