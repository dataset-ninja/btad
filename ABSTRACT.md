The authors of the **BTAD: beanTech Anomaly Detection** dataset introduce a novel transformer-based image anomaly detection and localization network **VT-ADL**. The BTAD dataset comprises real-world industrial anomaly data and consists of RGB images depicting three distinct industrial products. *product_1* features images with dimensions of 1600×1600 pixels, *product_2* with 600×600 pixels, and *product_3* with 800 × 600 pixels. Training data for Products 1, 2, and 3 comprises 400, 1000, and 399 images, respectively. During training, all images are initially scaled to a size of 512 pixels. For each anomalous image, a pixel-wise ground truth mask is meticulously provided.

In the realm of computer vision, anomalies refer to any image or image segment that exhibits significant deviations from predefined normal characteristics. Anomaly detection involves identifying these novel samples, either through supervised or unsupervised methods. There is a considerable demand for intelligent anomaly detection systems, given their wide-ranging applications, spanning from video surveillance and defect segmentation to quality control, medical imaging, and financial transaction monitoring. Notably, anomaly detection holds particular significance in the industrial sector, where it can facilitate the automated identification of defective products.
